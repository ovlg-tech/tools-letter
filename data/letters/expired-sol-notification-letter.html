    <div class="letter-heading"> Each state limits the amount of time a creditor has to sue you in order to collect on a
        debt. This is called the Statute of Limitation (SOL). Once the SOL has expired, the creditor can no longer take
        you to court to get a judgment that would allow them to place a lien on your property or garnish your wages. If
        the creditor or collection agency threatens to sue you after the expiration of the SOL, you should send them an
        Expired SOL Notification Letter and make them aware you know your rights. Here is a sample format of the Expired
        SOL Notification Letter: </div>

            communication of <input class="letter_input_box" placeholder="Date" type="text" value=""> regarding the
            collection on the account referenced above.<br><br>I
            do not believe that I owe this debt and therefore dispute this account. I have checked with my State
            Attorney
            General and verified that the Statute of Limitations for this kind of debt in [state in which contract was
            signed] has expired. If you intend to take this issue to court, I will find it necessary to inform the court
            that I have disputed of this debt and that the Statute of Limitations has already expired.<br><br>I am well
            aware of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and my state laws. This letter is a
            formal notification that I consider this matter closed and demand that neither you nor anyone associated
            with
            your company contact me except to inform me that collection efforts have been terminated or that you or the
            creditor are taking the specific actions allowed by the FDCPA and my state laws.<br><br>Henceforth, I shall
            consider any contact not in compliance with the FDCPA a violation of the law and will report it immediately
            to
            the State Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission. Please be advised that I keep a record of all phone
            calls and any violation of the FDCPA can result in you/your company being fined up to $1000 per incident in
            addition to my attorney fees and court costs.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Your
