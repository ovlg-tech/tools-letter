    <div class="letter-heading"> Are you troubled with a disputed item on your credit report? Is the item still
        appearing ona your credit report even after you have received a verified response from the credit bureaus? If
        that is bothering you, then you can send a letter to the credit bureaus to bring the disputed item to their
        notice. Here is a sample letter requesting for debt verification: </div>

            <p>Dear <input class="letter_input_box" placeholder="Sir/Madam" type="text" value="">,</p><br><br>I sent you
            a
            letter
            requesting that you remove inaccurate items from my credit report on [insert date of request]. But I am very
            disappointed to discover that the disputed information still exists on my report.<br><br>I demand a formal
            description of the procedure adopted by you to verify this claim. I would also like to know the names of the
            businesses, the addresses, and phone numbers of all the entities/people who were contacted during the
            verification process. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to be informed about all these
            details.<br><br>It is disappointing to find that a credit bureau does not maintain accuracy norms, despite a
            consumer's request for information verification. I request that you comply with the law and furnish me with
            all
            the required information that I am seeking, within a period of 15 business days.<br><br>I am resubmitting my
            request to expedite the verification procedure and look forward to hearing from
            you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>[Your signature]<br><br>[Your Name]<br>
